Code for CC2538 from Texas Instruments, which was used as a border-router in the Rime network.

The CC2538 modules run the open-source operating system Contiki found here https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki. Contiki comes with two wireless stacks which can be used to create multi-hop wireless networks (Rime and 6LoWPAN). For this project Rime was chosen.
